# AngularJS Utah Meetups!

Welcome to AngularJS Utah's GitHub happy place!

This repo is a place for EVERYONE to vote on and propose new topics for upcoming meetups. If you need to ([http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/)).

<hr />

Managing a meetup takes is a community effort!  We are trying to get more community involvement in choosing speakers and topics for our meetups.  What better way than creating a "Meetup Repository of Awesomeness"?!

2. Create a new "Issue" (e.g. Meeting Topic)
3. Set the title to **"[COOL_TALK_TITLE_GOES_HERE]"**, followed by your name if you are volunteering to speak on the topic.
