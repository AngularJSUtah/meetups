# Angular Utah Meetups!
We want to try using GitHub Issues to suggest topics for our meetups, vote for them, and volunteer for speaking about them.

To make a suggestion, vote for existing suggestions, or volunteer for speaking on a topic:

1. Go to the ["Issues"](https://github.com/AngularJSUtah/meetups/issues) page for this repository.
2. Create a new "Issue" (meeting topic), OR comment on an existing one.
